Hi, 👋,I'm Grisel Jimenez Soto, an Earth Scientist and Technology Enthusiastic  ⛰ from La Paz, Bolivia. Currently working as a Research Scientist at [South East Asia Carbonate Laboratory ](https://seacarledu.wordpress.com/) at [Universiti Teknologi Petronas] (https://www.utp.edu.my/Pages/Home.aspx) in Perak, Malaysia. 

Beside my current research, I enjoy traveling mountains around Asia 🗻 painting and collecting when possible rocks and fossils. 

Languages and Tools: Currently learning 

My current research:
Optimal Integrated Geological modeling for development planning and well and reservoir management is vital to reservoir simulation and economic decisions. A good workflow should be scaled and iterative allowing addition of detail to models where it is shown to be required. The objective of this research is to identify and analyze the best and most suitable workflows to reproduce geological “shapes” of object-based techniques of pore types of carbonate build-ups.
