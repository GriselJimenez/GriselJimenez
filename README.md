Hi, 👋,I'm Grisel Jimenez Soto, an Earth Scientist and Technology Enthusiastic  ⛰ from La Paz, Bolivia. Currently working as a Research Scientist at [South East Asia Carbonate Laboratory ](https://seacarledu.wordpress.com/) at Universiti Teknologi Petronas in Perak, Malaysia. 

Beside my current research, I enjoy traveling mountains around Asia 🗻 painting and collecting when possible rocks and fossils. 

Languages and Tools: Currently learning Python (OpenCv), QGis and R. 

My current research is about:

Optimal Integrated Geological modeling for development planning and well and reservoir management is vital to reservoir simulation and economic decisions. A good workflow should be scaled and iterative allowing addition of detail to models where it is shown to be required. The objective of this research is to identify and analyze the best and most suitable modelling workflows to reproduce geological “shapes” of object-based techniques from pore types in carbonate build-ups in South East Asia.
